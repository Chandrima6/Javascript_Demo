I have created a puzzle with 3 level of complication.
Double click the slidingHTML.html file to open in browser.
Move the slider to extreme left for the easiest scenerio and going forwards will be tougher.
Easiest one will be a 2 * 2 puzzle.
Next 4 * 4 and 6 * 6 puzzles.
Solve each puzzles to unlock the secret message.
